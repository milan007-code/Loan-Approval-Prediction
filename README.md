## Introduction

The goal of this project is to predict whether a loan will be approved based on various applicant details. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using different machine learning algorithms.

## Data Preprocessing

### Steps

1. **Log Transformation:** Logarithmic transformations are applied to certain columns to normalize their distributions.
2. **Handling Missing Values:** Missing values in categorical and numerical columns are filled with appropriate statistics like mode and mean.
3. **Feature and Target Variable Split:** The dataset is split into features and target variables for modeling.

## Visualizations

Count plots and other visualizations are created to understand the distribution of data and the relationships between different variables. Visualizations help in identifying patterns and insights that can guide model building.

## Modeling

Several machine learning models are trained and evaluated to predict loan approval. These include:

- Random Forest Classifier
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier

### Train-Test Split

The data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

### Encoding Categorical Variables

Categorical features are encoded to numerical values to be used by machine learning algorithms.

### Standardization

The features are standardized to ensure they are on the same scale, which can improve the performance of some machine learning algorithms.

## Evaluation

Each model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and other relevant metrics. The results are compared to select the best-performing model.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
